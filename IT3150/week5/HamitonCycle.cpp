/*
Given an undirected graph G = (V,E). Write a program to check if G is a Hamiltonian graph.
Input
Line 1: a positive integer T (number of graphs)
Subsequent lines are information about T graphs, each has the following format:
Line 1: n and m (number of nodes and edges)
Line i+1 (i = 1, 2, ..., m): u and v : two end points of the ith edge
Output
In the ith line, write 1 if the corresponding is a Hamiltonian graph, and write 0, otherwise

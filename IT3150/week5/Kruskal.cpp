/*
Given a undirected connected graph G=(V,E) where V={1,…,N}. Each edge (u,v)∈E(u,v)∈E has weight w(u,v)w(u,v). Compute minimum spanning tree of G.
Input
Line 1: N and M (1≤N,M≤10
5
) in which NN is the number of nodes and MM is the number of edges.
Line i+1 (i=1,…,M): contains 3 positive integers u, v, and w where w is the weight of edge (u,v)
Output
Write the weight of the minimum spanning tree found.

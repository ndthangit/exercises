/*
Given a string s[1…k] which is a sequence of characters taken from {‘a’, . . ., ‘z’}. Given a positive integer m, the hash code of s is defined by the formula:
H(s) =  (s[1]*256
k-1
 + s[2]*256
k-2
 + . . . + s[k]*256
0 
) mod m  (the contant integer m is a parameter)
Given a sequence of strings k1, k2, …, kn, compute the corresponding hash codes
Input
Line 1: n and m (1 <= n,m <= 100000)
Line i+1 (i = 1,2,…,n): contains the string ki (the length of each string is less than or equal to 200)
Output
Each line contains the corresponding hash code of n given strings
Example
Input
4 1000
a
ab
abc
abcd
Output
97
930
179
924
